![Double triangular probability distribution function][dtpdf]

3PE IaaS PoC: a [three-point estimation][1] calculator (but with [proper
calculations for the double-triangular distribution][2] instead of the
simplified hogwash on Wikipedia) showcasing automatic provisioning and
deployment.

A hobby project to try out [Vagrant], [Terraform], [AWS] and
[Github Actions].

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WIP ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is a work in progress. By one person. In his spare time. **Caveat emptor!**

---

## Frontend

* HTML5 SPA ([12-Factor]) built with [Bootstrap].
  * Simple table with functionality:
    * Add row with work package name.
    * Update row with best-case, most-likely, worst-case estimates.
    * Delete row.
  * Output below table:
    * Best estimate (95% confidence interval).
    * [Plotly] box plot of confidence intervals.
  * Button to select Lambda backend.
* Data stored in browser local storage or [Redis] (user choice).
* Load estimate from URL slug.
* Send estimate as permalink in an email.
* Served by an [nginx] container running in Amazon EC2.
* Some functionality available offline with [UpUp].

## Backend

* Calculates a three-point estimate based on an array of three-tuples.
* Implemented in Java, Go, Node.js, C#, Python and Ruby. Perl?
* Deployed as AWS Lambda functions.

## Other services

* [Mailgun] to send the estimate to a friend.
* [Open Distro for Elasticsearch] (on Amazon) for logging.
* [Sonarcloud] for static code analysis and QA.

## Baby Steps

### 0. Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have

* Windows 10 Pro,
* [Hyper-V enabled][3] and configured with a virtual bridge, and
* [Vagrant] 2.2.x installed.

If you want to use Vagrant Share, you also need the [ngrok] executable somewhere
on your `%PATH%`.

### 1. Vagrant

Vagrant is used to create a consistent development environment. Before the first
run ‚Äî which will provision the developer VM ‚Äî you need to fill in the missing
values in the `.env.template` file and rename it to `.env`. Enter your Windows
username as `user@domain`. Pick a canonical timezone name from the [tzdata list]
as the value for `TZ`, or remove the key to run the environment on UTC.

The development VM is an [Alpine] 3.11 image with an nginx web server serving
the `frontend` directory through a symlink, configured in the `Vagrantfile`.
If the `AWS_*` keys are set in your `.env` file, it will also have the AWS CLI
installed.

To launch and use the developer VM, now simply `vagrant up` in the root dir.
When the guest VM is ready, open the URL in the last line of the install log in
a browser on your host machine to verify that you can access the web server.

You can now edit the code in the `frontend` directory and immediately see your
changes in the browser (F5, natch).

<!--
To share your dev web server with the world through Vagrant Share, just
`vagrant share --http 4567`.
-->

### 2. AWS

To run the **Œª** functions you need an execution role. Open the [roles page] in
the IAM console and click *Create role*:

* Choose the Lambda use case
* Pick **AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole**
* No tags
* Name the role `lambda-execution-role`
