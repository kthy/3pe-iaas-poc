![Double triangular probability distribution function][dtpdf]

3PE IaaS PoC: a [three-point estimation][1] calculator (but with [proper
calculations for the double-triangular distribution][2] instead of the
simplified hogwash on Wikipedia) showcasing automatic provisioning and
deployment.

A hobby project to try out [Vagrant], [Terraform], [AWS] and
[Github Actions].

---

## Frontend

* HTML5 SPA built with [Vue.js]. (Or possibly just jQuery.)
  * Simple table with functionality:
    * Add row with work package name.
    * Update row with best-case, most-likely, worst-case estimates.
    * Delete row.
  * Output below table:
    * Best estimate (95% confidence interval).
    * [Plotly] box plot of confidence intervals.
  * Button to select Lambda backend.
* Data stored in browser local storage.
* Load estimate from URL slug.
* Send estimate as permalink in an email.
* Served by an [nginx] container running in Amazon EC2.
* Some functionality available offline with [UpUp].

## Backend

* Calculates a three-point estimate based on an array of three-tuples.
* Implemented in Java, Go, Node.js, C#, Python and Ruby. Perl?
* Deployed as AWS Lambda functions.

## Other services

* [Mailgun] to send the estimate to a friend.
* [Open Distro for Elasticsearch] for logging - remember there's an Amazon
  special.
* [Sonarcloud] for static code analysis and QA.

## Baby Steps

### 0. Prerequisites

This guide assumes Windows 10 Pro with [Hyper-V enabled][3] and configured with
a virtual bridge, plus [Vagrant] 2.2.7 installed. If you want to use Vagrant
Share, you also need the [ngrok] executable somewhere on your `%PATH%`.

### 1. Vagrant

Vagrant is used to provision a consistent development environment. To launch
the developer VM on Windows 10, simply

```bash
vagrant up --provider=hyperv
vagrant ssh
```

in the root dir. When you boot up the image, you will get a message asking for
your Windows credentials to mount SMB shares. Enter your username as
`user@domain`.

Make a note of the line that says `default: IP: 192.168.nnn.nnn`. When the
guest VM is ready, open <http://192.168.nnn.nnn> in a browser on your host
machine to verify that you can access the web server.

You can now edit the code in the `frontend` directory and immediately see your
changes in the browser (F5, natch).

The development VM is an Ubuntu 18.04 image with an nginx web server serving
the `frontend` directory through a symlink, configured in the `Vagrantfile` as
follows:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "hashicorp/bionic64"
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -q -y nginx=1.14.0-0ubuntu1.7
    if ! [ -L /var/www/html ]; then
      rm -rf /var/www/html
      ln -fs /vagrant/frontend /var/www/html
    fi
  SHELL
end
```
